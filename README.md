Make sure you have Python installed ([Download for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  
I used version 3.10.4

# Install Dependencies  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
If you get an error about building C++. Make sure you download [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022).
